        <h2><strong>Course Overview</strong></h2>
        <p>Welcome to Math Foundations! This course is designed to help you build a strong and confident understanding of the essential pre-algebra skills needed to succeed in Algebra 1. The course is delivered through a self-paced online program, allowing you to learn at a pace that works best for you.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">My role in this class is to be your guide and support system. While the primary lessons and assignments are provided by the online program, I am here to proctor, offer one-on-one help, provide examples, and lead mini-lessons whenever you need clarification or extra practice on a topic.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Our focus is on building a solid foundation through clear explanations and targeted practice to ensure you are fully prepared for your next steps in mathematics.</p>
